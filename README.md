First of all you need to know that I made this project for fun. I have not seriously cared about the code. 
I was just boring and had inspiration from one really grate website https://www.trolley.co.uk/.

As you see repo is public and it is on beta version (not tag on repo, just lable on site) you can take it an improve.
There I really many good features to add.

If you want to know how it works give a look `App\Console\Commands\FetchData::class`. 

At one moment I wanted to add tests so I created service, cache and repo layer for categories..

But you know what, I will tell you more
